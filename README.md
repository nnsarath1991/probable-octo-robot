This R Shiny application uses Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) Loans data available for public access from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) website. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose information about mortgages. These public data are important because they help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their communities; they give public officials information that helps them make decisions and policies; and they shed light on lending patterns that could be discriminatory.
