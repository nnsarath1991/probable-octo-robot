Background:

NCRC is a non-profit organization based out of Washington, DC that works with community leaders, policymakers and financial institutions to champion fairness in banking, housing and business development. NCRC’s research analyses provide powerful tools for advocates and organizations seeking to understand patterns of lending and investment in their communities.

Project:
The American Home Mortgage Loans (HMDA) process involves analysis of home mortgage loans data from different platforms and deriving insights about lending patterns of banks. This critical but tedious process involves a lot of steps like collecting data from different public platforms, updating formulas & pivot tables across different Excel sheets, etc. which is lengthy and error-prone.
This report goes over the specifications of the R Shiny Application which serves as an effective replacement from the current method employed at NCRC to mine American Home Mortgage Loans data (HMDA) and draw insights about lending patterns of banks in underserved American communities like low incomes communities and minority communities. Some of the analytical metrics calculated by the application include:
? Percentage of Loan Approvals across different racial & ethnic groups
? Percentage of Loan Rejects across different racial & ethnic groups
? Percentage of applicants from Low Income & Minority (LMI) communities
? Minority/Majority Census tracts, etc.
The information specified above go into reports used by the Research and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Enforcement teams who meet with regulators to contest bank mergers, negotiations or CRA reviews to negotiate more investment in that community.


Data used:
The application uses Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) Loans data available for public access from the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) website. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose information about mortgages. These public data are important because they help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their communities; they give public officials information that helps them make decisions and policies; and they shed light on lending patterns that could be discriminatory.
In 2016, there were 16.3 million HMDA records from 6,762 financial institutions.
